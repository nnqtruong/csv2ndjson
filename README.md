csv2ndjson.py convert .csv (Comma Sperated Value) to the new .json (Newline Delimited JSON format). This script is useful when a .json file is needed to upload to Google Cloud Platform.

In this example, we use laptop_price.csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price.

One problem you may face is the ' " ' syntax when the laptop have 14 inches screen. However, this was handled in the script as well.

Happy converting!
